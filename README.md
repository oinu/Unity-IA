# Unity-IA
This project is created for implement the AI game theory in Unity3D. All done by Eloi Salles Torres.

This repository contains:
* Steering Behaviors.
* Combined Steering Behaviors.
* Pathfinding.
* Decision Making.

## Steering Behaviors
It used for simulate a movement of the agent in a wolrd. 

We can find the most basics Steering Behaviors:
* Seek.
* Flee.
* Arrive.
* Pursue.
* Evade.
* Wander.
* Area Avoidence.
* Simple Path Following.
* Predicted Path Following.

## Combined Steering Behaviors
It combines some previous Steering Behaviors.

* Flocking (is a combined with weights).
* Combination1 (Area Avoidance, Predicted Path Following & Wander).

## Pathfinding
It contains algorithms is used for find goal. In the examples the goal is representated in world space.

These algorithms are:
* Breadth First Search.
* Dijkstra.
* Greedy Best First Search.
* A*.

## Decision Making
How the agent make decision at where it goes.

* Hardcode Finite State Machine.
